Local Setup
===========

*Every setup is different, but you can get inspiration of how someone else build their own.*

This is how I have setup my **Aphaea** to gether enviromental information:
- [RaspberryPi](http://raspberrypi.org/) as dedicated server, with PiCam
- WeatherStation: Alecto WS-4000 (also known as W1080), uses [pywws](https://github.com/jim-easterbrook/pywws) to read information.
- LUX, NO<sub>2</sub> and CO sensors (inspired by [AirPi](http://airpi.es/) )
- a few waterpumps to power irrigation of the garden and pond
