iconpacks.json
==============
``/media/icons/iconpacks.json`` lists the available iconpacks (or themes) and information on how to handle them. Each iconpack will need an [weather.alias](./weather.alias.md)-file to define the way each icon will be understood, compared to the (current/depicted) weather scenario.
